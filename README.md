## Introduction

I had to pass a technical test a few times ago to test my fullstack skills.
The company aims at put in relation cancer patients and clinical trials.
Given a csv with 5 columns (Speciliality, Organ, Id, Situation) I had to make a little search engines with filters.
The constraints were :
  * Use **SQLAlchemy**
  * using **Python** as Backend and **React** at front

I chose Flask because it is really small, you aren't annoyed by one thousand config file and it is really easy to debug. In addition, it couples well with SQLAlchemy.
And I just choose React because of my experience with it.

> Why publish it ?
Well, I had a few hard times while I was looking for tutorials (I am kind of a low level developper and my web skills aren't incredible) and I think it would be nice if people who are looking for a few things can find it in this repository.

## How to run it

TODO : Write a Dockerfile
In one terminal, run:
```bash
pip3 install -r api/requirements.txt
python3 api/models.py
python3 api.app.py
```
And in another one, run:
```bash
cd front; npm i
npm run start
```
And you should see the website running on http://localhost:3000. Enjoy!

### There is nothing on the Database
If you want to add clinical trials in the database, You can do it the following way :
```python
>>> import requests
>>> url = "http://localhost:5000/clinical_trial"
>>> res = requests.post(url, data={"id_bis": "NCT06", "speciality": "Thoracique", "organ": "poumon", "situation": "Métastatique"})
```
* **poumon** means lung
* **Métastatique** means metastatic
* **Thoracique** means thoracic, chest
